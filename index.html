      <p id="p1">In this page you will see three of my favorite games and why they're appealing to me.
         There is no particular order as to what video game is better than another.
          This is just to share some of my 
         opinions on what I think is fun to play. </p> <br>
      <p id="p2">The LittleBigPlanet series is a game series for those with creative and innovative minds. 
         It's a game I played a lot as a child with many friends. 
         You can play a story line, create your own worlds, and play on worlds that other people have published.
         LittleBigPlanet 2 is my personal favorite because it is filled with possibility.</p>

      <p id="p3"> Skyrim is a game played by millions of people.
          In Skyrim, the possible amount of questlines is virtually infinite.
         There are many unique paths that can be taken, which is attractive to players who enjoy stories of games.
         Skyrim is one of my all-time favorite games. 
         On computer and new consoles (Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X), 
         mods can be enabled for more diverse and unique gameplay. </p>

      <p id="p4"> Ark: Survival Evolved is a unique sandbox survival game where the playable character is on an island with dinosaurs. 
         In Ark, players can pick to fight with other people online, or team up to uncover the island's secrets.
      Ark is one of my favorites to play when fighting people because it requires a lot of strategy, and I love a challenge. </p>
